        Revision 1.5  2001/08/04 02:02:04  rbowen
        Added LICENSE
        Removed 'warnings' from Leapyear.pm so that it will run on earlier
        Perl 5's.

        Revision 1.4  2001/08/02 00:51:42  rbowen
        There's no reason to require 5.6

        Revision 1.3  2001/07/24 15:59:29  rbowen
        Changed the leapyear algorithm to be a little more readable. Moved
        tests to Test::More.

        Revision 1.2  2001/06/04 03:48:34  rbowen
        The readme file was apparently copied over from another project. Oops.
